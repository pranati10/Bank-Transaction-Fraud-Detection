# Bank Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on developing a sophisticated fraud detection system for banking using machine learning techniques. The system aims to increase the accuracy and efficiency of detecting fraudulent transactions.

*Dataset*
The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle named 'banksim', which contains transactional data from a Spanish bank. This dataset includes 594643 records with features like customer ID, age, gender, transaction category, amount, and fraud status.

*Methods*
The project employs decision trees and artificial neural networks (ANN) for fraud detection. Key methods include:

Data preprocessing and visualization to understand transaction patterns.
Implementation of decision trees with optimized hyperparameters.
Construction of an ANN model using Keras, with techniques like SMOTE for oversampling and normalization using MinMaxScaler.
Evaluation of models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

*Results*
The optimized decision tree showed high accuracy in classifying non-fraudulent transactions, while the ANN effectively detected complex fraudulent patterns.

*Conclusion*
The project demonstrates the efficacy of machine learning in enhancing fraud detection mechanisms in banking systems. Future work includes expanding the dataset and exploring ensemble learning techniques for improved accuracy.
