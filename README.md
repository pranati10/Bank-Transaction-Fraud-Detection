# Bank Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

***Overview**

This project focuses on developing a sophisticated fraud detection system for banking using machine learning techniques. The system aims to increase the accuracy and efficiency of detecting fraudulent transactions.

**Dataset**

The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle named 'banksim', which contains transactional data from a Spanish bank. This dataset includes 594643 records with features like customer ID, age, gender, transaction category, amount, and fraud status.

**Methods**

The project employs decision trees and artificial neural networks (ANN) for fraud detection. Key methods include:

+ Data preprocessing and visualization to understand transaction patterns.
+ Implementation of decision trees with optimized hyperparameters.
+ Construction of an ANN model using Keras, with techniques like SMOTE for oversampling and normalization using MinMaxScaler.
+ Evaluation of models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

**Results**

The optimized decision tree showed high accuracy in classifying non-fraudulent transactions, while the ANN effectively detected complex fraudulent patterns.

**Conclusion**

The project demonstrates the efficacy of machine learning in enhancing fraud detection mechanisms in banking systems. Future work includes expanding the dataset and exploring ensemble learning techniques for improved accuracy.
